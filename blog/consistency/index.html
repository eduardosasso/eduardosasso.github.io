      <h1>Consistency</h1>
<p>A little over a year ago after getting more into Stoicism, I decided to try writing a daily journal, no big ambitions just a couple of paragraphs reflecting on my day with just a simple rule. Don’t quit!</p>
<p>After many attempts, I was determined to learn Vim for real at the beginning of 2019 and use it for everything, including writing this very own blog post, the lesson? Embrace the suck!</p>
<p>At work aside from all the meetings, politics and managing, I still carve out time to write code — day in day out for weeks, months and years on end.</p>
<p>I find time to surf every good swell. Be it at 5:30 am or 8 pm, cold and sharky to sunny and perfect, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>I make the bed every day for years now; I read somewhere that said successful people do it, so I said why not? Bullshit or not I stuck with it.</p>
<p>Last year I took on woodworking, and since then I’ve built a ton of things including a workbench, a desk, a shoe rack, coat hanger, outdoor table, copper pipe coffee table respecting a single constraint to finish each project in one weekend.</p>
<p>On my spare time I’ve been working on a side project to scratch an itch for some time now, I’ve pivoted a couple of times, simplified a bunch, but I’m still griding until it gets shipped.</p>
<p>The thing is there’s no shortcut, progress seems slow but when I look back and realize I’m writing this blog post in the desk I’ve built, using my Vim skills and publishing it in the app I’ve developed feels damn awesome!</p>
<p>A handful of things and projects, more doing less consuming.</p>
<p>Consistency compounds.</p>
