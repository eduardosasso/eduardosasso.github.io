# Consistency

A little over a year ago after reading more on stoicism I decided to try writing a daily journal, no big ambitions just a couple paragraphs reflecting on my day with just a simple rule - don't quit!

One of my resolutions for 2019 was to make more things doesn't matter what it is as long I keep shipping it.

At work besides my role getting more into managing and planning I still carve out a good chunk of time to write code day in day out.

Every swell that shows in the forecast is in my radar and I'll surf it be it at 5:30am or 8pm I'll find time to be in the water.

I make the bed every day for decades now, I read something that said successfull people do it, bullshit or not I stuck with it.

Last year I took on woodworking and since then I've built a ton of things like a workbench, a cubicle to work in the garage, a shoe rack, coat hanger, outdoor table, copper pipe coffee table and a bunch of other small things with one caveat these projects need to be small enough so I can finish it in a weekend.

I've been working on a side project to scratch an itch for some time now, it will ship when it's done grinding it out but at a steady pace, one project at a time.

What has taken me a lifetime of learning and practice is to find that right cadence of not taking on too many things to feel overwelmed and give up but commit to a few things chores and some creative endevours so I can feel that sense of accomplishement something on a daily basis and the inevitable compound effect of simply being consistent.
