# Life is fragile
My mom used to say “Life is made of moments“  and I couldn’t quite understand it until I had a kid of my own.

As I read this tragic and heartbreaking post [It’s later than you think](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20928570) on Hacker News about this family that lost their healthy son seemingly overnight, I started pondering on my life choices and responsibility as a parent.

When my daughter was born, I knew I wanted to be present in her life. 
I didn’t want to only “provide” for my family, I wanted to be hands-on and split the hard work of changing poopy diapers, giving a bath,  put her to bed and play, tons of playing, tickles and cuddles.

I sometimes tell my wife that ordinary days are the best days and as I reflect on the story above with a knot in my throat, I’m grateful I’ve made that a priority in my life.

Almost five years ago, I became a parent. The startup I was working for didn’t have a parental leave policy back in the day, so I took one week off, and when I came back, I announced that would be working from home one day here and there to help my wife with our newborn.

Fast forward a couple of months, and our lease was due to renew. We knew that our single bedroom insanely expensive Bay Area apartment wouldn’t cut it, so it was time to find a new place to live.

As we made an offer and bought a house, my easy Caltrain commute of ten minutes became an hour and a half each way.  That led me to an agreement of working two days a week remotely and three in the office.

Pretty soon, those two days became three then four, then the whole week, and five years passed quickly by, and I was there, through my ups and downs, but I was present. 
I was working my butt off, but instead of taking a “facebook break” or whatever (insert your poison here) I would go and play with her for 5-10 minutes at a time, and I saw her grow in front of my eyes.

Heck, it isn’t all flowers but seeing how happy she gets it when I say that I’ll take her to gymnastics class in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon makes the whole difference in the world.
I’m not skipping work I’m just shifting it, work is 24/7 nowadays anyways.

The tide has been on my side, but I know circumstances change.
I don’t know what the next five years will be like. But every now and then I gotta remind myself that as cheesy as it sounds [Life is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html).

Now I finally understand what my mom was trying to say.

Life is made of moments.
