## From my first website circa 1996 fast forward to a product used by millions at Trip.com, then later at [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.com), I love the challenges, learnings, hard work, and grit it takes to create something from scratch and stick to it from beginning to end.

I’m a seasoned software engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset and product-oriented attitude with extensive expertise leading, building, and shipping large scale full-stack consumer internet applications with a keen eye for web design, user experience, and aesthetics.
